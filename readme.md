# 66 Days of Data Challenge with Ken Jee

This repo includes projects that I did during this challenge. 

## Examples

- [Translating SQL to Pandas](https://github.com/asad-mahmood/66DaysOfData/tree/main/SQL%20to%20Pandas) - A small project that I used to perpare for interviews where questions regarding translating SQL statements to pandas or vice versa were expected. It walks through how all the major keywords of SQL can be successfully translated to pandas statements.
- [Data Preprocessing and ML Template](https://github.com/asad-mahmood/66DaysOfData/tree/main/Data%20Preprocessing%20and%20ML%20Template) - A preprocessing template that I use for every project classification/regression to start with. I am using lazy predict package to test out which algo is the best suited for the project.
- [Fake News Detection](https://github.com/asad-mahmood/66DaysOfData/tree/main/Fake%20News%20Detection) - This project is about how to use tweets text and classify them. In this cproblem statement is to classify if the suggested tweets contain misinformation or not. The classification model used is Passive Aggressive Classfier and achieved 92 % accuracy score and 585 true positives, 590 true negatives, 48 false positives, and 44 false negatives.
